# vim-settings
My preferred settings for the Vi IMproved (VIM) text editor

## Install
Clone the repo as the `.vim` in your home directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:dabrygo/vim-settings.git $HOME/.vim
```

You may need to load from another, like 
`C:/Program Files/Vim/_gvimrc` by prepending 
with a line like

```
source ~/.vim/_gvimrc
```
